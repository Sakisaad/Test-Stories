            <p><span class="character">Mosaad</span> hadn't slept. After Nova left his motel room with the boundary question hanging in the air like smoke, he'd spent the night staring at the ceiling, thinking about webs and walls, openness and intention.</p>
            
            <p>He needed coffee. He needed air. He needed to think.</p>
            
            <p>What he didn't expect was to find <span class="sage-character">Sage Hartley</span> already there, sitting at a corner table with a camera, a notebook, and what looked like a half-finished philosophical manifesto scrawled across three napkins.</p>
            
            <p>She looked up as he entered. No surprise in her eyes. Just recognition.</p>
            
            <p>"Couldn't sleep either?" she asked.</p>
            
            <p>Mosaad hesitated, then sat down across from her. "You're stalking me now?"</p>
            
            <p>"I'm stalking good coffee. You just happen to have predictable patterns." She pushed a napkin toward him. "I've been thinking about your family. The web model. And I think I figured out what you're actually building."</p>
            
            <p>On the napkin, she'd drawn a diagram: not a hub-and-spoke model, not a traditional web, but something else—a constellation. Points of light connected by threads of varying brightness, some direct, some indirect, all part of a larger pattern that only made sense when you stepped back.</p>
            
            <div class="divine-moment">
                <div class="divine-title">The Constellation Theory</div>

                    <p><span class="sage-character">"You're not building a family,"</span> Sage said, her voice quiet but certain. <span class="sage-character">"You're building a constellation. Each person is a star. Some burn brighter than others at different times. Some are closer to you, some are closer to each other. The connections shift. The pattern changes. But the light—the collective light—remains."</span></p>
                    
                    <p><span class="sage-character">"And here's what I think you don't understand yet: constellations aren't closed systems. New stars can appear. Old stars can fade. The pattern evolves. That's not a weakness. That's what makes it alive."</span></p>
                    
                    <p>Mosaad stared at the napkin. At this stranger who'd filmed his breakdown and somehow turned it into cosmology.</p>
                    
                    <p>"Why are you telling me this?" he asked.</p>
                    
                    <p>Sage looked at him with those sharp, seeing eyes. "Because I want in."</p>

            </div>
            
            <p>The words hung in the air between them. Not romantic. Not desperate. Just honest.</p>
            
            <p>"I don't know you," Mosaad said carefully.</p>
            
            <p>"You didn't know Nova when you interviewed her for four hours and it went viral. You didn't know Victoria when she offered you a corporate deal. You didn't know Valentina when she offered you her mansion." Sage leaned forward. "But you knew something about them—some spark, some thread that made you think: this person belongs."</p>
            
            <p>"And you think you belong?"</p>
            
            <p>"I think I might. I think I see things you need someone to see. I think I ask questions you need someone to ask. I think I exist in the space between observer and participant in a way that could make your constellation more complex. More real. More—" she paused, searching for the word. "—<em>luminous</em>."</p>
            
            <p>Mosaad felt something shift in his chest. Not attraction, exactly. Something deeper. Recognition.</p>
            
            <p>"I need to talk to the family," he said.</p>
            
            <p>"I know. That's why I'm telling you now, before you decide we're 'complete.' Before you close the door out of fear that opening it again makes everything you've built meaningless." She stood, gathering her things. "I'll be at the Blanton Museum tomorrow at 2 PM. If you want to explore this—constellation theory, boundary questions, whatever this is—I'll be there. If not, I'll understand."</p>
            
            <p>She left. And Mosaad sat alone with a napkin diagram that looked like stars, thinking about the difference between walls and windows.</p>

            <p>They gathered in Valentina's living room—the five of them, the Impossible Family, still fragile, still learning the mathematics of love that multiplies.</p>
            
            <p><span class="character">Nova</span> sprawled on the couch, pink hair electric. <span class="character">Valentina</span> perched elegantly in her reading chair. <span class="character">Victoria</span> stood by the window, always needing an escape route. <span class="character">Veronica</span> sat cross-legged on the floor, dark eyes watching everything.</p>
            
            <p>And Mosaad, in the center, about to blow everything apart or make it whole.</p>
            
            <p>"I met someone," he said without preamble. "The TikToker. Sage. And she asked to be considered for the family."</p>
            
            <p>The temperature in the room dropped twenty degrees.</p>
            
            <p>"You've got to be fucking kidding me," Nova said, her voice dangerously quiet.</p>
            
            <p>"I'm not kidding. And I'm not saying yes. I'm bringing it to you. To us. Because this is exactly the question we've been avoiding: are we open or are we closed?"</p>
            
            <div class="revelation">
                <div class="revelation-title">Victoria's Analysis</div>
                <p><span class="character">Victoria</span> turned from the window, her strategic mind already processing. "Let me understand this correctly. The woman who filmed your breakdown, posted it publicly, and exposed a private moment—that woman now wants to join the family?"</p>
                
                <p>"She deleted the video after she understood what she'd captured," Mosaad said. "And she came to Nova at the museum to apologize. To explain."</p>
                
                <p>"Apologies don't erase violations," Victoria countered. "But I'm not arguing against her. I'm arguing for clarity. What does she bring that we don't already have? What thread does she add to the web?"</p>

                <p><span class="character">"She asked me a question that I haven't been able to stop thinking about,"</span> Nova admitted. <span class="character">"When is the web complete? And I realized—I don't want it to be complete. Not yet. Maybe not ever. Because the second we say 'this is everyone,' we become exactly what we're trying not to be: a closed system that rejects possibility."</span></p>
                
                <p><span class="character">"But,"</span> she continued, her voice sharp, <span class="character">"I also don't want us to collect people just because they're interesting. Sage is brilliant. She sees through things. But is that enough? Is intellectual chemistry enough to justify expanding when we're barely holding together as five?"</span></p>

            <div class="web-connection">
                <div class="parallel-title">VALENTINA'S WOUND</div>
                <p><span class="character">Valentina</span> spoke quietly, her voice carrying the weight of old pain. "I was the first. I gave you everything—my home, my resources, my belief in this vision when it was just a blog post everyone called delusional. And you left because I couldn't share well enough."</p>
                
                <p>"Now you're asking me to welcome a sixth person when I'm still learning to share you with four. When I'm still teaching my heart that your love for them doesn't diminish your love for me."</p>
                
                <p>She looked at Mosaad, tears threatening. "So tell me: is this about Sage? Or is this about you being unable to say no to possibility? About you collecting stars for your constellation because the pattern is never quite complete enough?"</p>

            <div class="web-connection">
                <div class="parallel-title">VERONICA'S CHALLENGE</div>
                <p><span class="character">Veronica</span> stood, her intensity filling the room. "I'm the newest. I'm still figuring out where I fit. And now you want to add someone else before I've even found my place in the web?"</p>
                
                <p>"But here's what I think: if we say no to her just because we're scared, we're building a cage. A beautiful cage where five people love each other and refuse to let anyone else in. And that's not a family. That's a club."</p>
                
                <p>"So my question is this: Mosaad, do you love her? Not intellectually appreciate her. Not find her fascinating. Do you actually <em>love</em> her? Because if you do, we need to deal with that. And if you don't, why are we even having this conversation?"</p>
            </div>
            
            <p>Mosaad sat with the question. With the weight of five pairs of eyes on him. With the ghost of a napkin constellation in his pocket.</p>
            
            <p>"I don't know if I love her," he said finally. "But I feel something. Some recognition. Like she sees the architecture of what we're building in a way that could make it stronger. Or could make it collapse. I don't know which."</p>
            
            <p>"Then invite her here," Victoria said, her voice calm and certain. "Not to join the family. To present herself. To let us see what you see. And then we decide—together—if the constellation expands or if we hold the boundary."</p>
            
            <p>Nova nodded slowly. Valentina's hand trembled but she didn't object. Veronica's eyes burned with something between fear and excitement.</p>
            
            <p>"Tomorrow," Mosaad said. "2 PM. The museum. And then we bring her here. And we see if fire and light can coexist."</p>

                <p>They arrived separately but as one—Nova and Victoria together, Valentina alone but present, Veronica watching from the edges, Mosaad in the center holding his breath.</p>
                
                <p>And <span class="sage-character">Sage</span>, standing in front of "The Broken Circle," exactly where she'd been when she first met Nova.</p>
                
                <p>She turned as they approached. No fear in her eyes. Just clarity.</p>
                
                <p>"I wasn't sure you'd come," she said.</p>
