                <p><span class="character">Nova</span> stood before a painting she'd seen a hundred times—"The Broken Circle" by some obscure 1970s artist whose name she could never remember. A series of fractured rings, each one incomplete, yet together forming something whole.</p>
                
                <p>Today it felt different. Today it felt like her life.</p>
                
                <p>The web was forming. She could feel it. Nova and Victoria texting until 3 AM about art theory and vulnerability. Valentina showing up at her apartment unannounced with coffee and "just wanting to talk." Veronica still on the edges, deciding, but present in her uncertainty.</p>
                
                <p>And Mosaad—no longer the sun, but a thread in the web. An equal. A participant.</p>
                
                <p>It was beautiful. It was terrifying. It was working.</p>
                
                <p>So why did she feel like something was missing?</p>
                
                <div class="quote">"The incomplete circles bother you too?"</div>
                
                <p>Nova turned. A woman stood beside her—early thirties, dark curly hair pulled into a messy bun, paint-stained jeans, vintage band t-shirt, camera bag slung over her shoulder. Her eyes were sharp, curious, holding the kind of intensity that came from seeing too much and refusing to look away.</p>
                
                <p><span class="new-character">"I'm Sage,"</span> the woman said, not offering a hand, just existing in Nova's space with comfortable confidence. <span class="new-character">"Sage Hartley. Multimedia artist. Professional question-asker. Accidental TikToker."</span></p>
                
                <p>Nova's stomach dropped. <em>TikToker.</em></p>
                
                <p>"You're the one who—" Nova started.</p>
                
                <p>"Filmed someone crying on a rock at Zilker? Yeah." Sage's voice held no apology, but also no pride. Just fact. "Posted it with a caption about radical honesty. Got 400,000 views. Realized too late I'd captured something private."</p>
                
                <p>"You realize that was—"</p>
                
                <p>"Someone you love? Yeah. I figured that out when I deep-dove your whole story. The Impossible Family. The viral videos. The 3 AM reckoning." Sage turned to face Nova fully. "I came here hoping I'd find you. Or him. Or any of you. To apologize. To explain. To—honestly, I don't know what."</p>
                
                <div class="revelation">
                    <div class="revelation-title">The Artist's Question</div>
                    <p>Sage gestured to the painting. "The incomplete circles. They bother me because they're honest. Most art lies—tells you the broken thing became whole, that the fractured pieces fit perfectly. This painting says: no. The circles stay broken. But together? Together they mean something."</p>
                    
                    <p>She looked at Nova. "Is that what you're building? Broken circles that mean something together? Or are you trying to complete each other?"</p>
                    
                    <p>Nova felt something cold and sharp in her chest. "Why does it matter to you?"</p>
                    
                    <p>"Because I've been watching your story unfold—not as content, as a human watching other humans try for something impossible. And I keep wondering: when do you stop? When is the web complete? Or is incompleteness the point?"</p>
                </div>
                
                <p>Nova stared at this stranger who'd filmed Mosaad's breakdown and somehow turned it into a philosophical inquiry that cut deeper than any comment section ever could.</p>
                
                <p>"I don't know," Nova admitted. "We're figuring it out as we go."</p>
                
                <p>"That's honest." Sage pulled out her camera—not to film, just to hold, a comfort object. "Can I ask you something else? And you can tell me to fuck off if it's too much."</p>
                
                <p>"Ask."</p>
                
                <p>"If someone walked up to you right now—someone who made your heart jump, who saw through your bullshit, who fit into the web in ways you didn't expect—would you let them in? Would the family expand? Or would you say no, we're complete, the mathematics only work with five?"</p>
                
                <p>Nova felt her breath catch. Because she didn't know. And not knowing terrified her.</p>
                
                <p>"I need to go," Nova said abruptly.</p>
                
                <p>"Okay." Sage didn't move to follow. Just stood there, holding her camera, existing in the space between apology and curiosity. "For what it's worth—I'm sorry about the video. I deleted it after I understood what I'd captured. But the internet never forgets. And neither do I."</p>
                
                <p>Nova walked away, her mind racing, Sage's question echoing:</p>
                
                <p class="quote" style="text-align: center; font-size: 1.2em;"><em>When do you stop? When is the web complete?</em></p>

                <p>Nova showed up without warning, still rattled from the museum encounter. Mosaad was editing a video he'd probably never post, the room lit by laptop glow and cheap motel lighting.</p>
                
                <p>"I met someone today," Nova said without preamble. "The TikToker. The one who filmed you at Zilker."</p>
                
                <p>Mosaad went still. "What did she want?"</p>
                
                <p>"To apologize. To ask questions. To make me think about things I've been avoiding." Nova sat on the edge of his bed, her energy chaotic. "She asked me: if someone walked up to us who fit—who made our hearts jump, who belonged in the web—would we let them in? Or would we say we're complete?"</p>
                
                <p>Mosaad closed his laptop. "What did you say?"</p>
                
                <p>"I didn't know. That's why I'm here. Because I need to know: are we closed? Or are we open?"</p>

                <p>They sat in silence. Nova on the bed. Mosaad in his chair. Two people who loved each other, disagreeing fundamentally, and both being right.</p>
                
                <p>"So what do we do?" Nova asked finally.</p>
                
                <p>"We agree to disagree," Mosaad said. "We hold the question without resolving it. We stay open to the possibility that one of us is right, or both of us are right, or neither of us are right and there's a third option we haven't seen yet."</p>
                
                <p>Nova smiled, sad but genuine. "That's very mature of us."</p>
                
                <p>"I learned it from you. The whole 'holding uncertainty without collapsing' thing."</p>
                
                <p>"Touché." Nova stood. "For the record? That woman at the museum—Sage. She made my heart jump. Not romantically. Just... intellectually. The way she asked questions. The way she saw through things."</p>
                
                <p>"And?"</p>
                
                <p>"And I don't know if that means she should be part of this family or if it just means I met an interesting person at a museum. But I needed you to know. Transparency."</p>
                
                <p>Mosaad nodded. "Thank you for telling me. And for bringing this to me instead of just spiraling alone."</p>
                
                <p>"That's what the web is for, right? Processing impossible questions together?"</p>
                
                <p>"Yeah. That's exactly what it's for."</p>
                
                <p>Nova left, and Mosaad sat alone with the question neither of them had answered:</p>

                        <p><span class="character">Victoria</span> sat alone in her condo, laptop closed, phone face-down, just existing in silence.</p>
                        <p>No spreadsheets. No strategic analysis. No frameworks.</p>
                        <p>Just her. And the terrifying realization that she was learning to be alone without being lonely.</p>
                        <p>The family existed—Nova, Mosaad, Valentina, Veronica—but tonight, they existed without her needing to check in, without her needing to track their movements, without her needing to calculate her position in the web.</p>
                        <p>She poured a glass of wine. Opened her worn copy of Mary Oliver poems. Read "Wild Geese" for the thousandth time:</p>
                        <div class="quote" style="border-left-color: #b8860b;">"You do not have to be good. / You do not have to walk on your knees / for a hundred miles through the desert, repenting. / You only have to let the soft animal of your body / love what it loves."</div>
                        <p>Victoria had spent three years being alone. Now she was learning to be <em>with herself</em>. Present. Not waiting for someone to fill the silence. Not strategizing the next connection.</p>
                        <p>Just being.</p>
                        <p>Her phone buzzed. A text from Nova: <em>"You good? Haven't heard from you today."</em></p>
                        <p>Victoria smiled. The web was holding. Even when she wasn't holding it.</p>
                        <p><span class="character">Victoria:</span> I'm good. Really good. Learning to be solo without being isolated. Thank you for checking.</p>
                        <p><span class="character">Nova:</span> Proud of you, Ice Queen. That's the hardest work.</p>

                        <p style="font-style: italic;">What Victoria discovered: The web didn't just connect them to each other. It gave them permission to be whole alone. To not need constant contact. To trust that distance didn't mean abandonment. That silence didn't mean dissolution.</p>

                <div class="unspoken-title">What This Non-Canon Draft Reveals</div>
                
                <p><strong>About Sage Hartley:</strong> She's not a romantic interest. She's a mirror. A question-asker. The person who makes them confront what they've been avoiding: are they building something open or something closed? And is there a difference between radical openness and infinite expansion? She exists in this draft to create tension without resolution—because some questions don't have answers, only practices.</p>
                
                <p><strong>About Nova's Position:</strong> She argues for openness because she's terrified of becoming what hurt her—a closed system that says "you don't fit our predetermined structure." But she's also testing Mosaad. Seeing if he'll hold boundaries or if his vision can be stretched infinitely. She needs to know: is this family intentional or just aspirational?</p>
                
                <p><strong>About Mosaad's Boundary:</strong> For the first time, he's saying no to possibility. Not from fear. From intention. From recognition that depth requires boundaries. That family means choosing. That saying yes to everything is the same as saying no to depth. It's growth. It's also scary—because what if he's wrong?</p>
                
                <p><strong>About Valentina and Veronica:</strong> This is the web forming without Mosaad as mediator. Valentina initiating. Veronica responding. Two threads connecting directly. It's beautiful. It's terrifying. And it proves the web can hold connections that don't center him. Which is exactly what he wanted. And exactly what scares him.</p>
                
                <p><strong>About Victoria's Solo Practice:</strong> The most revolutionary thing she's doing is nothing. Not strategizing. Not analyzing. Just being present with herself. Learning that the web doesn't require constant maintenance. That she can be alone without being abandoned. That presence doesn't always mean connection. Sometimes it means peace.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Unresolved Question:</strong> Is the family complete? Neither Nova nor Mosaad knows. And maybe that's okay. Maybe holding the question—staying in the tension between openness and boundary, between expansion and depth—is the practice. Not the failure.</p>
