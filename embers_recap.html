                    <p>Connections between all of them—not just through him. Nova and Victoria building something. Valentina and Nova exploring their fascination. Victoria and Valentina understanding each other.</p>
                    <div class="quote">"If we build connections with each other, you're not the center anymore. You're a participant. An equal. And that means you can't control whether this works. You have to trust us to build it with you. And with each other."</div>

                <p><strong>What Mosaad still doesn't see:</strong> Letting go of control is the beginning, not the end. He'll face moments where connections form without him. Where he's not invited. Where being equal means accepting the web forms around him, not through him.</p>
                
                <p><strong>What Valentina is hiding:</strong> The kiss was her test. Whether she could be vulnerable first. Whether he'd meet her in the messy middle. She passed. But the bigger test—staying when she's not the primary connection—hasn't come yet.</p>
                
                <p><strong>What Nova and Victoria are building:</strong> It started with a kiss. Growing through late-night texts. But neither knows what it means. Friendship or more. Whether building something together strengthens the family or threatens it.</p>
                
                <p><strong>What Veronica witnessed:</strong> She was at Zilker too. Saw Mosaad on the rock before Valentina found him. Almost approached. Didn't. Because she needed to see if he could survive distance. He passed. Barely.</p>
                
                <p><strong>What the algorithm captured:</strong> Someone filmed Mosaad crying on the rock. Uploaded to TikTok: "The polyamory guy breaking down in public." 400,000 views. None of them know yet. But they will.</p>
